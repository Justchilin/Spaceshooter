Space-shooter game I made in high-school.

SETUP
It is configured for Visual Studio 15. After cloning and building, copy folders Art, Font and Audio into the Release folder. Also copy allegro_monolith-5.1.dll from Allegro folder to Release.

ART AND OTHER
I made almost all art in the game (you could've guessed that).
