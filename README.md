# README #

A simple Space Shooter 2D game I have made in high-school. It was based on Mike Geig's "Introduction to 2D game programming with Allegro" tutorial.
Everything was coded in C or C++03 originally, later I refactored C parts to C++.
Some unnecessary optimizations might be found in the codebase (such as cache-friendly containers). They are not needed, however I wanted to practice the implementation.

# SETUP #

It was tested with Visual Studio 15. After compiling, copy allegro monolith-5.1.dll from Allegro folder to Release.
Unce upon a time, this also worked on Linux, however I had too much problems with library linking and I have abandoned it.

# ART AND OTHER #

I grabbed font from 1001 fonts, where no copyright was requested.
SFX were made with Bfxr.
Some art I made, while other stayed from the Mike Geig's tutorial.
